However the container may use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see Configure logging drivers in the Docker documentation.  AWS Batch currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the LogConfiguration data type). Additional log drivers may be available in future releases of the Amazon ECS container agent.  This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"   The Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register the logging drivers available on that instance with the ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options. For more information, see Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
