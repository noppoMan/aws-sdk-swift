/**
Client object for interacting with AWS CostExplorer service.

The Cost Explorer API enables you to programmatically query your cost and usage data. You can query for aggregated data such as total monthly costs or total daily usage. You can also query for granular data, such as the number of daily write operations for Amazon DynamoDB database tables in your production environment.  Service Endpoint The Cost Explorer API provides the following endpoint:    https://ce.us-east-1.amazonaws.com    For information about costs associated with the Cost Explorer API, see AWS Cost Management Pricing.

Reservations provide a discounted hourly rate (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand pricing. AWS generates your recommendations by identifying your On-Demand usage during a specific time period and collecting your usage into categories that are eligible for a reservation. After AWS has these categories, it simulates every combination of reservations in each category of usage to identify the best number of each type of RI to purchase to maximize your estimated savings.  For example, AWS automatically aggregates your Amazon EC2 Linux, shared tenancy, and c4 family usage in the US West (Oregon) Region and recommends that you buy size-flexible regional reservations to apply to the c4 family usage. AWS recommends the smallest size instance in an instance family. This makes it easier to purchase a size-flexible RI. AWS also shows the equal number of normalized units so that you can purchase any instance size that you want. For this example, your RI recommendation would be for c4.large because that is the smallest size instance in the c4 instance family.
