 Amazon Managed Blockchain is a fully managed service for creating and managing blockchain networks using open source frameworks. Blockchain allows you to build applications where multiple parties can securely and transparently run transactions and share data without the need for a trusted, central authority. Currently, Managed Blockchain supports the Hyperledger Fabric open source framework.
