/**
Client object for interacting with AWS SNS service.

Amazon Simple Notification Service Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that enables you to build distributed web-enabled applications. Applications can use Amazon SNS to easily push real-time notification messages to interested subscribers over multiple delivery protocols. For more information about this product see https://aws.amazon.com/sns. For detailed information about Amazon SNS features and their associated API calls, see the Amazon SNS Developer Guide.  We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your preferred programming language. The SDKs contain functionality that automatically takes care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing your service requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses. For a list of available SDKs, go to Tools for Amazon Web Services.
