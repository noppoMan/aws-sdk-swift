/**
Client object for interacting with AWS Health service.

AWS Health The AWS Health API provides programmatic access to the AWS Health information that appears in the AWS Personal Health Dashboard. You can use the API operations to get information about AWS Health events that affect your AWS services and resources.  You must have a Business or Enterprise support plan from AWS Support to use the AWS Health API. If you call the AWS Health API from an AWS account that doesn't have a Business or Enterprise support plan, you receive a SubscriptionRequiredException error.  AWS Health has a single endpoint: health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS). Use this endpoint to call the AWS Health API operations. For authentication of requests, AWS Health uses the Signature Version 4 Signing Process. If your AWS account is part of AWS Organizations, you can use the AWS Health organizational view feature. This feature provides a centralized view of AWS Health events across all accounts in your organization. You can aggregate AWS Health events in real time to identify accounts in your organization that are affected by an operational event or get notified of security vulnerabilities. Use the organizational view API operations to enable this feature and return event information. For more information, see Aggregating AWS Health events in the AWS Health User Guide.  When you use the AWS Health API operations to return AWS Health events, see the following recommendations:   Use the eventScopeCode parameter to specify whether to return AWS Health events that are public or account-specific.   Use pagination to view all events from the response. For example, if you call the DescribeEventsForOrganization operation to get all events in your organization, you might receive several page results. Specify the nextToken in the next request to return more results.

Before you can call this operation, you must first enable AWS Health to work with AWS Organizations. To do this, call the EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization operation from your organization's master account. When you call the DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization operation, you specify the organizationEventDetailFilters object in the request. Depending on the AWS Health event type, note the following differences:   If the event is public, the awsAccountId parameter must be empty. If you specify an account ID for a public event, then an error message is returned. That's because the event might apply to all AWS accounts and isn't specific to an account in your organization.   If the event is specific to an account, then you must specify the awsAccountId parameter in the request. If you don't specify an account ID, an error message returns because the event is specific to an AWS account in your organization.    For more information, see Event.

Results are sorted by lastModifiedTime, starting with the most recent event.    When you call the DescribeEvents operation and specify an entity for the entityValues parameter, AWS Health might return public events that aren't specific to that resource. For example, if you call DescribeEvents and specify an ID for an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, AWS Health might return events that aren't specific to that resource or service.
