/**
Client object for interacting with AWS SESV2 service.

Amazon SES API v2 Welcome to the Amazon SES API v2 Reference. This guide provides information about the Amazon SES API v2, including supported operations, data types, parameters, and schemas.  Amazon SES is an AWS service that you can use to send email messages to your customers. If you're new to Amazon SES API v2, you might find it helpful to also review the Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide. The Amazon SES Developer Guide provides information and code samples that demonstrate how to use Amazon SES API v2 features programmatically. The Amazon SES API v2 is available in several AWS Regions and it provides an endpoint for each of these Regions. For a list of all the Regions and endpoints where the API is currently available, see AWS Service Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. To learn more about AWS Regions, see Managing AWS Regions in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These Availability Zones are physically isolated from each other, but are united by private, low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network connections. These Availability Zones enable us to provide very high levels of availability and redundancy, while also minimizing latency. To learn more about the number of Availability Zones that are available in each Region, see AWS Global Infrastructure.

When you perform a predictive inbox placement test, you provide a sample message that contains the content that you plan to send to your customers.

Before you can use an identity to send email, you first have to verify it. By verifying an identity, you demonstrate that you're the owner of the identity, and that you've given Amazon SES API v2 permission to send email from the identity. When you verify an email address, Amazon SES sends an email to the address. Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link in the verification email.  When you verify a domain without specifying the DkimSigningAttributes object, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens. You can convert these tokens into CNAME records, which you then add to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. This verification method is known as Easy DKIM. Alternatively, you can perform the verification process by providing your own public-private key pair. This verification method is known as Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM). To use BYODKIM, your call to the CreateEmailIdentity operation has to include the DkimSigningAttributes object. When you specify this object, you provide a selector (a component of the DNS record name that identifies the public key that you want to use for DKIM authentication) and a private key.
