/**
Client object for interacting with AWS Polly service.

Amazon Polly is a web service that makes it easy to synthesize speech from text. The Amazon Polly service provides API operations for synthesizing high-quality speech from plain text and Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML), along with managing pronunciations lexicons that enable you to get the best results for your application domain.

Each voice speaks a specified language, is either male or female, and is identified by an ID, which is the ASCII version of the voice name.  When synthesizing speech ( SynthesizeSpeech ), you provide the voice ID for the voice you want from the list of voices returned by DescribeVoices. For example, you want your news reader application to read news in a specific language, but giving a user the option to choose the voice. Using the DescribeVoices operation you can provide the user with a list of available voices to select from.  You can optionally specify a language code to filter the available voices. For example, if you specify en-US, the operation returns a list of all available US English voices.  This operation requires permissions to perform the polly:DescribeVoices action.
