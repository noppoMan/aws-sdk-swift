You must not delete an EndpointConfig in use by an endpoint that is live or while the UpdateEndpoint or CreateEndpoint operations are being performed on the endpoint. To update an endpoint, you must create a new EndpointConfig.  The endpoint name must be unique within an AWS Region in your AWS account.  When it receives the request, Amazon SageMaker creates the endpoint, launches the resources (ML compute instances), and deploys the model(s) on them.  When Amazon SageMaker receives the request, it sets the endpoint status to Creating. After it creates the endpoint, it sets the status to InService. Amazon SageMaker can then process incoming requests for inferences. To check the status of an endpoint, use the DescribeEndpoint API. For an example, see Exercise 1: Using the K-Means Algorithm Provided by Amazon SageMaker.  If any of the models hosted at this endpoint get model data from an Amazon S3 location, Amazon SageMaker uses AWS Security Token Service to download model artifacts from the S3 path you provided.

This is the largest workforce, but it should only be used for public data or data that has been stripped of any personally identifiable information.   You can also use automated data labeling to reduce the number of data objects that need to be labeled by a human. Automated data labeling uses active learning to determine if a data object can be labeled by machine or if it needs to be sent to a human worker. For more information, see Using Automated Data Labeling. The data objects to be labeled are contained in an Amazon S3 bucket. You create a manifest file that describes the location of each object. For more information, see Using Input and Output Data. The output can be used as the manifest file for another labeling job or as training data for your machine learning models.

To host your model, you create an endpoint configuration with the CreateEndpointConfig API, and then create an endpoint with the CreateEndpoint API. Amazon SageMaker then deploys all of the containers that you defined for the model in the hosting environment.  To run a batch transform using your model, you start a job with the CreateTransformJob API. Amazon SageMaker uses your model and your dataset to get inferences which are then saved to a specified S3 location. In the CreateModel request, you must define a container with the PrimaryContainer parameter. In the request, you also provide an IAM role that Amazon SageMaker can assume to access model artifacts and docker image for deployment on ML compute hosting instances or for batch transform jobs. In addition, you also use the IAM role to manage permissions the inference code needs.

Amazon SageMaker also provides a set of example notebooks. Each notebook demonstrates how to use Amazon SageMaker with a specific algorithm or with a machine learning framework.  After receiving the request, Amazon SageMaker does the following:   Creates a network interface in the Amazon SageMaker VPC.   (Option) If you specified SubnetId, Amazon SageMaker creates a network interface in your own VPC, which is inferred from the subnet ID that you provide in the input. When creating this network interface, Amazon SageMaker attaches the security group that you specified in the request to the network interface that it creates in your VPC.   Launches an EC2 instance of the type specified in the request in the Amazon SageMaker VPC. If you specified SubnetId of your VPC, Amazon SageMaker specifies both network interfaces when launching this instance. This enables inbound traffic from your own VPC to the notebook instance, assuming that the security groups allow it.   After creating the notebook instance, Amazon SageMaker returns its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). After Amazon SageMaker creates the notebook instance, you can connect to the Jupyter server and work in Jupyter notebooks. For example, you can write code to explore a dataset that you can use for model training, train a model, host models by creating Amazon SageMaker endpoints, and validate hosted models.
