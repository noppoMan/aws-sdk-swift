If an algorithm supports the Pipe input mode, Amazon SageMaker streams data directly from S3 to the container.   In File mode, make sure you provision ML storage volume with sufficient capacity to accommodate the data download from S3. In addition to the training data, the ML storage volume also stores the output model. The algorithm container use ML storage volume to also store intermediate information, if any.   For distributed algorithms using File mode, training data is distributed uniformly, and your training duration is predictable if the input data objects size is approximately same. Amazon SageMaker does not split the files any further for model training. If the object sizes are skewed, training won't be optimal as the data distribution is also skewed where one host in a training cluster is overloaded, thus becoming bottleneck in training.

You can also use data splitting to improve performance by processing multiple concurrent mini-batches. The default value for SplitType is None, which indicates that input data files are not split, and request payloads contain the entire contents of an input object. Set the value of this parameter to Line to split records on a newline character boundary. SplitType also supports a number of record-oriented binary data formats. When splitting is enabled, the size of a mini-batch depends on the values of the BatchStrategy and MaxPayloadInMB parameters. When the value of BatchStrategy is MultiRecord, Amazon SageMaker sends the maximum number of records in each request, up to the MaxPayloadInMB limit. If the value of BatchStrategy is SingleRecord, Amazon SageMaker sends individual records in each request.  Some data formats represent a record as a binary payload wrapped with extra padding bytes. When splitting is applied to a binary data format, padding is removed if the value of BatchStrategy is set to SingleRecord. Padding is not removed if the value of BatchStrategy is set to MultiRecord.
