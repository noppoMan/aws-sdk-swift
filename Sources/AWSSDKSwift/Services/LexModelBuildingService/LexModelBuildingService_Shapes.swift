For example, in response to a follow-up prompt that says "Would you like anything else today?" the user says "Yes." Amazon Lex will return a 400 Bad Request exception because it does not have a clarification prompt to send to the user to get an intent.   Lambda function - When using a Lambda function, you return an ElicitIntent dialog type. Since Amazon Lex does not have a clarification prompt to get an intent from the user, it returns a 400 Bad Request exception.
