/**
Client object for interacting with AWS CognitoIdentity service.

Amazon Cognito Federated Identities Amazon Cognito Federated Identities is a web service that delivers scoped temporary credentials to mobile devices and other untrusted environments. It uniquely identifies a device and supplies the user with a consistent identity over the lifetime of an application. Using Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, you can enable authentication with one or more third-party identity providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon) or an Amazon Cognito user pool, and you can also choose to support unauthenticated access from your app. Cognito delivers a unique identifier for each user and acts as an OpenID token provider trusted by AWS Security Token Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials. For a description of the authentication flow from the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide see Authentication Flow. For more information see Amazon Cognito Federated Identities.

The developer provider is the "domain" by which Cognito will refer to your users. You can use GetOpenIdTokenForDeveloperIdentity to create a new identity and to link new logins (that is, user credentials issued by a public provider or developer provider) to an existing identity. When you want to create a new identity, the IdentityId should be null. When you want to associate a new login with an existing authenticated/unauthenticated identity, you can do so by providing the existing IdentityId.

If you supply both, DeveloperUserIdentifier will be matched against IdentityID. If the values are verified against the database, the response returns both values and is the same as the request. Otherwise a ResourceConflictException is thrown.  LookupDeveloperIdentity is intended for low-throughput control plane operations: for example, to enable customer service to locate an identity ID by username. If you are using it for higher-volume operations such as user authentication, your requests are likely to be throttled. GetOpenIdTokenForDeveloperIdentity is a better option for higher-volume operations for user authentication. You must use AWS Developer credentials to call this API.

If the users to be merged are associated with the same public provider, but as two different users, an exception will be thrown. The number of linked logins is limited to 20. So, the number of linked logins for the source user, SourceUserIdentifier, and the destination user, DestinationUserIdentifier, together should not be larger than 20. Otherwise, an exception will be thrown. You must use AWS Developer credentials to call this API.

Each tag consists of a key and value, both of which you define. A key is a general category for more specific values. For example, if you have two versions of an identity pool, one for testing and another for production, you might assign an Environment tag key to both identity pools. The value of this key might be Test for one identity pool and Production for the other. Tags are useful for cost tracking and access control. You can activate your tags so that they appear on the Billing and Cost Management console, where you can track the costs associated with your identity pools. In an IAM policy, you can constrain permissions for identity pools based on specific tags or tag values. You can use this action up to 5 times per second, per account.
