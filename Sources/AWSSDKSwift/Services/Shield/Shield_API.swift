This enables the DRT to inspect your AWS WAF configuration and create or update AWS WAF rules and web ACLs. You can associate only one RoleArn with your subscription. If you submit an AssociateDRTRole request for an account that already has an associated role, the new RoleArn will replace the existing RoleArn.  Prior to making the AssociateDRTRole request, you must attach the AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy managed policy to the role you will specify in the request. For more information see Attaching and Detaching IAM Policies. The role must also trust the service principal  drt.shield.amazonaws.com. For more information, see IAM JSON Policy Elements: Principal. The DRT will have access only to your AWS WAF and Shield resources. By submitting this request, you authorize the DRT to inspect your AWS WAF and Shield configuration and create and update AWS WAF rules and web ACLs on your behalf. The DRT takes these actions only if explicitly authorized by you. You must have the iam:PassRole permission to make an AssociateDRTRole request.
