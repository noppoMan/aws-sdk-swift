This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting, the operation fails. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role in the IAM User Guide. By default, the value is set to 3600 seconds.   The DurationSeconds parameter is separate from the duration of a console session that you might request using the returned credentials. The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token takes a SessionDuration parameter that specifies the maximum length of the console session. For more information, see Creating a URL that Enables Federated Users to Access the AWS Management Console in the IAM User Guide.

        /// A unique identifier that might be required when you assume a role in another account. If the administrator of the account to which the role belongs provided you with an external ID, then provide that value in the ExternalId parameter. This value can be any string, such as a passphrase or account number. A cross-account role is usually set up to trust everyone in an account. Therefore, the administrator of the trusting account might send an external ID to the administrator of the trusted account. That way, only someone with the ID can assume the role, rather than everyone in the account. For more information about the external ID, see How to Use an External ID When Granting Access to Your AWS Resources to a Third Party in the IAM User Guide. The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/-

You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see Session Policies in the IAM User Guide. The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies shouldn't exceed 2048 characters. The JSON policy characters can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid character list (\u0020 through \u00FF). It can also include the tab (\u0009), linefeed (\u000A), and carriage return (\u000D) characters.  The characters in this parameter count towards the 2048 character session policy guideline. However, an AWS conversion compresses the session policies into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. This is the enforced limit. The PackedPolicySize response element indicates by percentage how close the policy is to the upper size limit.

For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails.

The DurationSeconds parameter is separate from the duration of a console session that you might request using the returned credentials. The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token takes a SessionDuration parameter that specifies the maximum length of the console session.
