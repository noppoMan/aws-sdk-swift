    ///  Creates an Amazon Forecast dataset. The information about the dataset that you provide helps Forecast understand how to consume the data for model training. This includes the following:     DataFrequency  - How frequently your historical time-series data is collected.     Domain  and  DatasetType  - Each dataset has an associated dataset domain and a type within the domain. Amazon Forecast provides a list of predefined domains and types within each domain. For each unique dataset domain and type within the domain, Amazon Forecast requires your data to include a minimum set of predefined fields.     Schema  - A schema specifies the fields in the dataset, including the field name and data type.   After creating a dataset, you import your training data into it and add the dataset to a dataset group. You use the dataset group to create a predictor. For more information, see howitworks-datasets-groups. To get a list of all your datasets, use the ListDatasets operation. For example Forecast datasets, see the Amazon Forecast Sample GitHub repository.  The Status of a dataset must be ACTIVE before you can import training data. Use the DescribeDataset operation to get the status.

You provide the location of your training data in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset that you want to import the data to. You must specify a DataSource object that includes an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the data. For more information, see aws-forecast-iam-roles. The training data must be in CSV format. The delimiter must be a comma (,). You can specify the path to a specific CSV file, the S3 bucket, or to a folder in the S3 bucket. For the latter two cases, Amazon Forecast imports all files up to the limit of 10,000 files. To get a list of all your dataset import jobs, filtered by specified criteria, use the ListDatasetImportJobs operation.

To retrieve the forecast for a single item at low latency, use the operation. To export the complete forecast into your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, use the CreateForecastExportJob operation. The range of the forecast is determined by the ForecastHorizon value, which you specify in the CreatePredictor request, multiplied by the DataFrequency value, which you specify in the CreateDataset request. When you query a forecast, you can request a specific date range within the forecast. To get a list of all your forecasts, use the ListForecasts operation.  The forecasts generated by Amazon Forecast are in the same time zone as the dataset that was used to create the predictor.  For more information, see howitworks-forecast.  The Status of the forecast must be ACTIVE before you can query or export the forecast. Use the DescribeForecast operation to get the status.

    ///  Creates an Amazon Forecast predictor. In the request, you provide a dataset group and either specify an algorithm or let Amazon Forecast choose the algorithm for you using AutoML. If you specify an algorithm, you also can override algorithm-specific hyperparameters. Amazon Forecast uses the chosen algorithm to train a model using the latest version of the datasets in the specified dataset group. The result is called a predictor. You then generate a forecast using the CreateForecast operation. After training a model, the CreatePredictor operation also evaluates it. To see the evaluation metrics, use the GetAccuracyMetrics operation. Always review the evaluation metrics before deciding to use the predictor to generate a forecast. Optionally, you can specify a featurization configuration to fill and aggregate the data fields in the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset to improve model training. For more information, see FeaturizationConfig. For RELATED_TIME_SERIES datasets, CreatePredictor verifies that the DataFrequency specified when the dataset was created matches the ForecastFrequency. TARGET_TIME_SERIES datasets don't have this restriction. Amazon Forecast also verifies the delimiter and timestamp format. For more information, see howitworks-datasets-groups.  AutoML  If you want Amazon Forecast to evaluate each algorithm and choose the one that minimizes the objective function, set PerformAutoML to true. The objective function is defined as the mean of the weighted p10, p50, and p90 quantile losses. For more information, see EvaluationResult. When AutoML is enabled, the following properties are disallowed:    AlgorithmArn     HPOConfig     PerformHPO     TrainingParameters    To get a list of all of your predictors, use the ListPredictors operation.
