StatusDetails can be one of the following values:   Pending: The command has not been sent to the instance.   In Progress: The command has been sent to the instance but has not reached a terminal state.   Delayed: The system attempted to send the command to the target, but the target was not available. The instance might not be available because of network issues, the instance was stopped, etc. The system will try to deliver the command again.   Success: The command or plugin was run successfully. This is a terminal state.   Delivery Timed Out: The command was not delivered to the instance before the delivery timeout expired. Delivery timeouts do not count against the parent command's MaxErrors limit, but they do contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.   Execution Timed Out: The command started to run on the instance, but the execution was not complete before the timeout expired. Execution timeouts count against the MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.   Failed: The command wasn't run successfully on the instance. For a plugin, this indicates that the result code was not zero. For a command invocation, this indicates that the result code for one or more plugins was not zero. Invocation failures count against the MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.   Canceled: The command was terminated before it was completed. This is a terminal state.   Undeliverable: The command can't be delivered to the instance. The instance might not exist or might not be responding. Undeliverable invocations don't count against the parent command's MaxErrors limit and don't contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.   Terminated: The parent command exceeded its MaxErrors limit and subsequent command invocations were canceled by the system. This is a terminal state.

By using this policy, you can receive notification before or after the expiration time is reached, in units of days or hours. NoChangeNotification: This policy triggers a CloudWatch event if a parameter has not been modified for a specified period of time. This policy type is useful when, for example, a secret needs to be changed within a period of time, but it has not been changed.

Advanced parameters have a value limit of 8 KB and can be configured to use parameter policies. You can create a maximum of 100,000 advanced parameters per account and per Region. Advanced parameters incur a charge. If you don't specify a parameter tier when you create a new parameter, the parameter defaults to using the standard tier. You can change a standard parameter to an advanced parameter at any time. But you can't revert an advanced parameter to a standard parameter. Reverting an advanced parameter to a standard parameter would result in data loss because the system would truncate the size of the parameter from 8 KB to 4 KB. Reverting would also remove any policies attached to the parameter. Lastly, advanced parameters use a different form of encryption than standard parameters. If you no longer need an advanced parameter, or if you no longer want to incur charges for an advanced parameter, you must delete it and recreate it as a new standard parameter.
