        /// A string map of event-specific data that you might choose to record. For example, if a user rates a movie on your site, you might send the movie ID and rating, and the number of movie ratings made by the user. Each item in the map consists of a key-value pair. For example,  {"itemId": "movie1"}   {"itemId": "movie2", "eventValue": "4.5"}   {"itemId": "movie3", "eventValue": "3", "numberOfRatings": "12"}  The keys use camel case names that match the fields in the Interactions schema. The itemId and eventValue keys correspond to the ITEM_ID and EVENT_VALUE fields. In the above example, the eventType might be 'MovieRating' with eventValue being the rating. The numberOfRatings would match the 'NUMBER_OF_RATINGS' field defined in the Interactions schema.
