/**
Client object for interacting with AWS Support service.

AWS Support The AWS Support API reference is intended for programmers who need detailed information about the AWS Support operations and data types. This service enables you to manage your AWS Support cases programmatically. It uses HTTP methods that return results in JSON format.    You must have a Business or Enterprise support plan to use the AWS Support API.    If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise support plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see AWS Support.    The AWS Support service also exposes a set of AWS Trusted Advisor features. You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check results, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of checks. The following list describes the AWS Support case management operations:    Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels. The DescribeServices and DescribeSeverityLevels operations return AWS service names, service codes, service categories, and problem severity levels. You use these values when you call the CreateCase operation.    Case creation, case details, and case resolution. The CreateCase, DescribeCases, DescribeAttachment, and ResolveCase operations create AWS Support cases, retrieve information about cases, and resolve cases.    Case communication. The DescribeCommunications, AddCommunicationToCase, and AddAttachmentsToSet operations retrieve and add communications and attachments to AWS Support cases.   The following list describes the operations available from the AWS Support service for Trusted Advisor:    DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks returns the list of checks that run against your AWS resources.   Using the checkId for a specific check returned by DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks, you can call DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult to obtain the results for the check that you specified.    DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries returns summarized results for one or more Trusted Advisor checks.    RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck requests that Trusted Advisor rerun a specified check.    DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses reports the refresh status of one or more checks.   For authentication of requests, AWS Support uses Signature Version 4 Signing Process. See About the AWS Support API in the AWS Support User Guide for information about how to use this service to create and manage your support cases, and how to call Trusted Advisor for results of checks on your resources.
