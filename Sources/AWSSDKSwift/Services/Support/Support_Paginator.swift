You can set values for the includeResolvedCases and includeCommunications parameters to specify how much information to return. The response returns the following in JSON format:   One or more CaseDetails data types.   One or more nextToken values, which specify where to paginate the returned records represented by the CaseDetails objects.   Case data is available for 12 months after creation. If a case was created more than 12 months ago, a request might return an error.    You must have a Business or Enterprise support plan to use the AWS Support API.    If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise support plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message appears.
