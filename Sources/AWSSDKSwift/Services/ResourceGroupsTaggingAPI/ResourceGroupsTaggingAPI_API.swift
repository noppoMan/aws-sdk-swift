/**
Resource Groups Tagging API This guide describes the API operations for the resource groups tagging. A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag consists of a key and a value, both of which you define. For example, if you have two Amazon EC2 instances, you might assign both a tag key of "Stack." But the value of "Stack" might be "Testing" for one and "Production" for the other. Tagging can help you organize your resources and enables you to simplify resource management, access management and cost allocation.  You can use the resource groups tagging API operations to complete the following tasks:   Tag and untag supported resources located in the specified region for the AWS account   Use tag-based filters to search for resources located in the specified region for the AWS account   List all existing tag keys in the specified region for the AWS account   List all existing values for the specified key in the specified region for the AWS account    To use resource groups tagging API operations, you must add the following permissions to your IAM policy:    tag:GetResources     tag:TagResources     tag:UntagResources     tag:GetTagKeys     tag:GetTagValues    You'll also need permissions to access the resources of individual services so that you can tag and untag those resources. For more information on IAM policies, see Managing IAM Policies in the IAM User Guide. You can use the Resource Groups Tagging API to tag resources for the following AWS services.

You can optionally specify filters (tags and resource types) in your request, depending on what information you want returned. The response includes all tags that are associated with the requested resources.  You can check the PaginationToken response parameter to determine if a query completed. Queries can occasionally return fewer results on a page than allowed. The PaginationToken response parameter value is null only when there are no more results to display.
