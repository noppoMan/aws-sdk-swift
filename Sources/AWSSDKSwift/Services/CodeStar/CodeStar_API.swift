/**
Client object for interacting with AWS CodeStar service.

AWS CodeStar This is the API reference for AWS CodeStar. This reference provides descriptions of the operations and data types for the AWS CodeStar API along with usage examples. You can use the AWS CodeStar API to work with: Projects and their resources, by calling the following:    DeleteProject, which deletes a project.    DescribeProject, which lists the attributes of a project.    ListProjects, which lists all projects associated with your AWS account.    ListResources, which lists the resources associated with a project.    ListTagsForProject, which lists the tags associated with a project.    TagProject, which adds tags to a project.    UntagProject, which removes tags from a project.    UpdateProject, which updates the attributes of a project.   Teams and team members, by calling the following:    AssociateTeamMember, which adds an IAM user to the team for a project.    DisassociateTeamMember, which removes an IAM user from the team for a project.    ListTeamMembers, which lists all the IAM users in the team for a project, including their roles and attributes.    UpdateTeamMember, which updates a team member's attributes in a project.   Users, by calling the following:    CreateUserProfile, which creates a user profile that contains data associated with the user across all projects.    DeleteUserProfile, which deletes all user profile information across all projects.    DescribeUserProfile, which describes the profile of a user.    ListUserProfiles, which lists all user profiles.    UpdateUserProfile, which updates the profile for a user.
